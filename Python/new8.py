#Write a function called unique_english_letters that takes the string word as a parameter. The function should return the total number of unique letters in the string. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as different letters.

#Weâ€™ve given you a list of every uppercase and lower case letter in the English alphabet. It will be helpful to include that list in your function.

letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write your unique_english_letters function here:

def unique_english_letters(word): 
  total_counter = 0
  for letter in letters:
    count = word.count(letter)
    if count !=0:
      total_counter+=1
  return total_counter
      

# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
#print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
# should print 4
#print(unique_english_letters("Apple"))
# should print 4
print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
